The iRPC chambers will demand changes, in comparison with the current system, in terms of design and electronics~\cite{muon_tdr}. In terms of electronics, a completely new FEB is being developed. This one should \textbf{(1) ensure the chamber efficiency in a high rate environment (up to 2 ${\boldmath kHz/cm^2}$) and (2) provide information for a 2-dimensional readout}. To achieve the requirements, \textbf{the iRPC FEB will use PETIROC ASICs~\cite{petiroc}}, with 32-channels each, for pre-amplification and discrimination of strip signals, providing low-jitter trigger with accurate charge and time measurements. 


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=gray!40!black]
    \textbf{Each strip end will be connected to one channel of the PETIROC. The digitized signal is sent to a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array), where a high resolution Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) is implemented, allowing 2D measurement of the muon hit by measuring the arrival time difference of the two strip ends}.

There are two versions of the iRPC FEB: FEBv0 (only one PETIROC2A and an Altera Cyclone II FPGA) and FEBv1 (with two PETRIOC2B and same FPGA). Figure 3 shows, for FEBv1, the Muon Efficiency versus Effective High  Voltage (HVeff, taking into account pressure and temperature effects) and the mean multiplicity, for cosmics data taken at GIF++, considering the High and Low Radius (HR and LR) strip ends and the logical "AND" of them. Future versions under development includes schematics closer to final version, radiation hard FPGA (PolarFire) and the possibility of a newer version of the PETIROC ASIC (2C, with automatic latching of individual channels).
